Today, our widespread literary education—characterized by continuous reading and writing—has made conversation less helpful and sometimes even a hindrance to developing argumentative skill. Conversely, during Socrates' time, extensive familiarity with debate actually hindered the art of writing. The speeches found in Thucydides illustrate how challenging it was to craft clear, logical reasoning within a continuous narrative. The traditions of lively conversation—characterized by quick exchanges and counterpoints—persisted in rhetorical prose. This verbal sparring was symbolized by the formidable _chevaux de frise_ of carefully crafted antitheses, where each clause gained strength and clarity through contrast with its opponent."
